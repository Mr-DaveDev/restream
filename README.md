Restream
=============

## Description

Restream is a program that allows the user to set up their own television channels for 
use with the TVHeadend application.

The set up is a bit manual but the result provides an additional set of channels that 
randomly play the videos specified in the directory along with being listed in the TV guide.

Right now, this program is for personal use but if other users find it of interest,
send me a note and I will polish it up for more general use.
